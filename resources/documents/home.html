                    This is primarily created as a continuous learning exercise for me to play with
                    various web technologies, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>Big Three</strong> of web languages,
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li title="HyperText Markup Language (content)">
                                HTML

                                CSS
                            </li>
                            <li title="JavaScript (functionality)">
                                JS
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            server-side programming, in languages such as C&#35;, PHP, Ruby, Python, and more
                            JavaScript,
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            good web practices, such as device scaling (translation: not looking like shit on
                            your phone), AJAX transfers, session tracking, and all the other fun
                            behind-the-scenes tricks that make web traffic go smoothly,
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            and lastly, server programming and use in various environments. At completely
                            sporadic intervals, this site will be switching among:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                GitHub Pages reading static pages out of a repository
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Amazon AWS &mdash; Windows Server 2012 hosting IIS
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Amazon AWS &mdash; Ubuntu hosting Apache
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Microsoft Azure
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                My personal computer here at Trine
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Raspberry Pi hanging off my bed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            as I learn how to work with the various services, including doing things myself
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One of the problems of trying to learn how to do content delivery is not having any
                    content to deliver. Peruse my TES writings, a half-baked coding project that I
                    mostly do to demonstrate some level of competence in new languages, or anything else
                    I happen to have in the nav bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that more pages are being added, you may notice that there is no actual
                    navigation &ndash; the address of your browser never changes and the history stack
                    receives no further data. This is because the main content is swapped in and out
                    using jQuery's AJAX handlers. The site is both static and shallow; everything can be
                    reached from the navbar below the banner image. Since the transmitted documents are
                    very small and contain no embedded CSS or JavaScript, there should not be any delay,
                    but even if there is it is certainly less than requesting an entirely new page which
                    will have the framework duplicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ajax is cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sorry if you get a bit of unresponsiveness, though.
