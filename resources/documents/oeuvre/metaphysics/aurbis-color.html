Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>
In keeping with the spirit of writing esoteric extrapolations late at night, I
present to you the sequel of my
            <span class="fake-link" onclick="OeuvreLoader('metaphysics/aurbis-music.html');">

            </span>
concerning the Gods as Tones: the synæsthesia of Gods, Tones, and Colors. We
know that the Magne-Ge are colors, and given that synæsthesia seems to be a
profound mechanic of the universe (Tonal Architecture is the synæsthesia of
Sound and Touch, for instance), I arrived at the conclusion that the Tones and
Colors are merely two physical translations of the Gods.

        <p>
Firstly: a quick recap. Go reread <i>Aurbis &mdash; The Musical</i>. The list of
Gods and Tones is going to be the most important part. Also feel free to play
the music included here.

        <p>
Now, we&rsquo;ll need these images for reference.

        <h2>
Lorkhan, the Beat
        </h2>
        <p>
Before I delve into the meat of this post, I want to quickly cover one thing.
Look at the blank Wheel. See how the Aedric Tones are long, the 7 Prominent
Daedra are middling, and the 10 Lesser Daedra are the shortest?
        </p>
        <p>
Circles are defined as a function of two variables: r (radius) and &theta;
(angle). The Gods are arrayed using &theta;, but their status is determined by
r. The Gods most associated with Lorkhan, the Aedra, have the highest r-values.
The next level of Lorkhanic association (the Reclamations are strongly
associated with him, and the House of Troubles are also tied into the kalpic
nature of the world, but all are Daedra) are weaker, but still strong. Lastly,
the ten remaining Daedra are associated with the tones with least commonality
and power. As with my Music post yesterday, Lorkhan continues to be utterly
different from, yet equally necessary, as the rest of the pantheon.
        </p>
        <h2>
Color and Tone
        </h2>
        <p>
I apologize for data-spam, but this is the unified Tone/Color/God table and
I&rsquo;m going to base the rest of this post off of it. For ease of reading,
the Aedra are in bold and the Prominent Daedra in italics.

If you remember my definition of the color wheel, you'll see that C&#9839;, Red,
happens to land on a Daedric Prince, whereas the other two are on Aedra
(Kynareth and Julianos). This may seem a little strange, considering that one of
the tenets of my Musical Theory of Mundus is that the Aedra are the key Tones
and the Daedra are less important. But look again at just who the pillar is:
MALACATH. Malacath is formerly Trinimiac, an Aedra, who was changed (transposed,
if you will) later on.
        </p>
        <p>
As an aside, the number 3 in TES is extremely significant in a few different
overarching ways. One of these, the Triune House, is composed of two extremes
and an intermediary. Trinimalacath is a primarily Elven deity, and Kynareth is
primarily human. Julianos, however, is revered by both Elves and Men and his
sphere (magic and intellectualism) is relevant to both.
        </p>
        <p>
So. Let&rsquo;s talk physics and theory (and also terror. <em>blackens
hands</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
While human hearing in our world begins at ~20Hz and extends to ~16kHz, human
sight ranges from 4x10^14 Hz to 8X10^14 Hz. This is a much smaller window and
there are many fewer color combinations possible than there are musical
combinations. And while both sound and color are linear, they <em>can</em> be
mapped onto a circle. With color, this creates non-spectrum colors (the cyan
family). Also, whereas color is a linear/circular set, musical tones are arrayed
in a logarithmic pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
However, TES physics are not necessarily identical to those of our own world,
and we would all do well to remember this.
        </p>
        <p>
I want you to visualize a helix. It&rsquo;s a screw: as a point rotates in a
circle, the center moves along an orthogonal axis, creating a twist rather than
a closed loop. If you look at it from the side, you see a sine wave, but if you
look at it head-on, it makes a circle.
        </p>
        <p>
The Color and Tone wheels are, in fact, this helix. Each revolution is one
octave. While we can perceive many turns of the Tone Helix, we only see one turn
of the Color Helix. We can, however, assume that the Color Helix extends beyond
our perception in the same manner as Tones do, and that the Gods are associated
with their periodic Colors as they are with periodic Tones (the Octaves).
        </p>
        <h2>
Syn&aelig;sthesia
        </h2>
        <p>
The mixture of &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; senses into single fields is one that
features strongly in TES lore. Pure Song is perceived as all of the mortal
senses, since this Song is what creates the world. Tonal Architecture reshapes
the Song and sculpts matter. The Thu&#39;um translates Voice into Color and
Force. Color and Tone are intertwined in many regards and it is no stretch at
all to unify them. Furthermore, the use of cross-sensory perception in the
mythos of Mundus further illustrates the nature of the Dream state that Godhead,
Anu, the Captive Sage, and perhaps more to come experience.
        </p>
        <h1>
Summary
        </h1>
        <p>
Not only can the world be described through Tone, but also Color. Furthermore,
the two are intimately related and may be two aspects of the same fundamental
concept.
