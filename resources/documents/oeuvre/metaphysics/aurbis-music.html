Foreword: Play the music as you read. It really goes with the essay.

        <p>
Music is the underlying force of the TES universe. It has laws and structures
governing its function in the world just as physics does. This is my effort to
describe the Theory of Music.

        <h1>
The Octave
        </h1>
        <p>
The octave is used both on Earth and in Mundus as a perfect set. 8 has abundant
significance in numerology. So let's assume that Mundus keeps the eight gods,
eight notes pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
The problem is that the octave goes CDEFGABC. See the problem? C happens twice.
This is true in any transposed octave. So using the Imperial pantheon of
Akatosh, Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Mara, Kynareth, Stendarr, and Zenithar, I
chose to take Dibella and Mara as the twin C notes, as they are the most
similar-yet-different gods.
        </p>
        <p>
So our octave goes like this
        </p>
        <blockquote id="aedra-keys">
            <p>
<strong>C</strong> Mara
                <br />
<strong>D</strong> Zenithar
                <br />
<strong>E</strong> Arkay
                <br />
<strong>F</strong> Kyne
                <br />
<strong>G</strong> Stendarr
                <br />
<strong>A</strong> Akatosh
                <br />
<strong>B</strong> Julianos
                <br />
<strong>C</strong> Dibella
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
Why this ordering, you ask? I explained Mara/Dibella as C above, but let&rsquo;s
expand on this.
        </p>
        <p>
Akatosh is the <strong>fundamental tuning pitch</strong> of this entire system.
In the beginning of pitch-standardization, pitches were based off organ pipe
heights. A, 440Hz, was an eight-foot pipe. Ada-Mantia as a Tower would be the
tuning length for Akatosh, A.
        </p>
        <p>
So with Akatosh defined as the A note of any octave, the rest begins to fall
into place.
        </p>
        <p>
C,E,G make a third, and so I wanted some of the more basic gods in there. Arkay,
life/death, and Stendarr, mercy and fortitude, fit well with the
&ldquo;feel&rdquo; of theCEG chord (it is strong and works very well, but not
very &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;).
        </p>
        <p>
F, however is a pretty note, and so that's where Kyne went. F is also the third
Important note of the scale (F, G, and A are basically the stars of the show).
With Kyne as F, Mara became low C and Dibella high C. (Incidentally, a perfect
fourth, C-F, is exactly a half-octave, so the waves resonate very well with each
other.)
        </p>
        <p>
This leaves D and B open, and Zenithar and Julianos to be placed. I placed
Julianos next to Akatosh and Dibella, since his sphere of intellectual work is
close (sort of) to Beauty and the Fundamental. Zenithar, labor, goes well next
to Arkay&rsquo;s life/death and Mara's family.
        </p>
        <h1>
The Accidentals
        </h1>
        <p>
This is where we break off <strong>markedly</strong> from the music you know.
Western canon uses the 12-tone C C&#9839; D D&#9839; E F F&#9839; G G&#9839; A
A&#9839; B octave. This only has five accidentals, which is where the Daedra go.
The Daedra are in the set of Creation, but their tones are alien to it and can
work for or against it, depending on use. Daedra fit very well as accidentals.
However, we need sixteen. To this end, we turn to the 24-tone scale, C
C&#9839;&#9837; C&#9839; D&#9837;&#9839; D D&#9839;&#9837; D&#9839;
E&#9837;&#9839; E E&#9839; F F&#9839;&#9837; F&#9839; G&#9837;&#9839; G
G&#9839;&#9837; G&#9839; A&#9837;&#9839; A A&#9839;&#9837; A&#9839;
B&#9837;&#9839; B B&#9839;&#9837;. Note that every note of the twelve-tone now
has a halfway note to its right, including the formerly-accidental-free note
pairs of B/C and E/F.
        </p>
        <p>
We have sixteen-and-one Daedra depending on how you count Sheo/Jyggalag. And
while the description of the Wheel as having eight Spokes and sixteen
Spoke-Voids may make you think there are two voids between each spoke, this does
not necessarily have to be true. The octave is not evenly spaced for the primal
chords, so the Wheel Spokes are not rotationally symmetric. Their spacing is not
made less beautiful as a result. Rather, this asymmetry is what makes the Octave
as a whole more special.
        </p>
        <p>
Notice how the Four Corners of the House of Troubles and the Three Good Daedra
fall into place exactly in between the Aedric Tones. My placement logic for the
Daedra is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
The Four Corners of the House of Troubles and Three Good Daedra are not
necessarily placed HGHGHGH, as perfect rotational symmetry is unneeded.
        </p>
        <p>
The seven selected Daedra are to go in the seven gaps-between-Aedric-Tones, and
are to be neighbored by Aedra whose properties are similar to their own. Mara is
familial, and Zenithar governs labor. Malacath embodies both of those.
Zenithar&rsquo;s work and Arkay&rsquo;s life/death are both touched by Mehrunes
Dagon&rsquo;s destruction (ruining the former, speeding the latter). Azura,
Twilight, is similar to Arkay and Kyne&rsquo;s Wind. And so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
The ten remnant Daedra are to be attached to the five Daedra who have room for
quarter-tones. <strong>Again, note that in the 12-tone octave, there is no
accidental between E/F and B/C, so in the 24-tone, E&#9839; and B&#9839; are the
quarter-tones and cannot have tertiary notes.</strong> Namira and Vaermina are
associated with ostracism and persecution, and are placed to either side of
Malacath by what they destroy. Namira destroys families, and Vaermina labor.
Clavicus Vile is bad bartering to Zenithar&#9839;s good, and Peryite is illness
and death. And so forth.

Incidentally, if one makes this list into a wheel, with Aedric overtones as the
longest spokes, the 7 Prominent Daedra with spokes of middling length, and the
ten remaining Princes as the shortest spokes, one gets this result (the C
Wheel). However, if we rotate so that D is our top, the end result (the D Wheel)
is reflectively symmetric. D Major is incidentally commonly called the Heavenly
Key in the Western music canon, and having Work in such a subtly special place
is rather fitting in my opinion.
        </p>
        <h2>
Lorkhan
        </h2>
        <p>
There is more to music than just the tones. The beat, the rhythm, the measure,
all terms for one underlying piece: tones alone are nothing without the
foundation given by the drumline. And this is, of course, the Ninth God, the
Doom Drum, Lorkhan. (It is pretty ironic that the Space God provides the
music&rsquo;s Time, but Time and Space are intermingled oddly here) Lorkhan is
not a Tone, but the Sound-without-Tone, the Pulse. Separate from the Octave and
just as necessary to the Performance as it.

In conclusion, I present to you the Orchestra of the Aurbis, in structure and
form. The Song goes ever onwards, and though sections may be silenced, silence
is ever a part of music. So long as the Conductor stands, the Song will go on.
The coda of a kalpic movement does not necessarily herald the conclusion of the
Performance, but merely provides an opportunity for a new movement, a new
expression of the Great Song, to be played. The Symphony is complete in and of
itself, and can never be destroyed. All they require, is an Audience.
        </p>
        <p>
All it requires, is us.
