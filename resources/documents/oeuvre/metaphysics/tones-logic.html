This is the full rationale behind my assignation of Gods to Tones and Colors.

        <h1>
Aedra
        </h1>
        <p>
The first entity I defined was Akatosh as A, since A is the fundamental definition
tone and Akatosh as time is a fundamental definition of Mundus. Furthermore, his
Ada-Mantia Tower is both the first Tower and can also be used as a physical
interpretation of His Note. And his name starts with A, which just reinforced this
choice.
        </p>
        <p>
I then looked through the remaining seven to determine which two I could put as
different sides of the same note, since there are only seven discrete primary notes
in the Octave, but we have eight Aedra. I chose Mara and Dibella, both of whom have
aspects of Love, and refrained from deciding which took low and which high until
later.
        </p>
        <p>
The C/E/G/C arpeggio is a very solid and plain chord, and I reasoned that the gods
on it should be the same. Not fancy, but strong and harmonic. Mara and Dibella were
already chosen, and of the remaining Aedra I reasoned that Stendarr&rsquo;s Justice
and Arkay&rsquo;s Life/Death provenance were the most suited. As Justice is
something of an opposite to Love, I chose to place Stendarr squarely between the
ends, at G, and Arkay took E. This also defined Mara and Dibella&rsquo;s placement,
as Mara the Mother is closer to Arkay than is Dibella the Wife. Mara took low C and
Dibella high.
        </p>
        <p>
Kyne is a very important but relatively isolated character. Since the perfect fourth
is a half-octave, low-C to F forms a wonderful chord on their own but do not combine
well with further notes. Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, so placing Kyne at F made
perfect sense.
        </p>
        <p>
We have now defined C, E, F, G, A, and C, leaving D and B open. D and B are the
underappreciated notes of the Octave, and coincidentally, Zenithar and Julianos are
the underappreciated gods of the pantheon. Zenithar is Labor and Julianos is
Knowledge. I chose to place Zenithar next to Mara, as they are Father and Mother,
and Julianos&rsquo; book-knowledge neighbored Dibella&rsquo;s bed-knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
This fills out the primary notes of the Octave.
        </p>
        <h1>
Daedra
        </h1>
        <h2>
High Daedra
        </h2>
        <p>
According to the Dunmeri pantheon, there are Three Good Daedra and Four Corners of
the House of Troubles. This selection (Azura, Boethiah, Mephala, Molag Bal,
Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, and Sheogorath) comprises the better-known Princes
throughout Tamriel. Seven prominent Daedra, seven prominent accidentals. I elected
to place them between their antitheses as best I could.
        </p>
        <p>
Between Mara and Zenithar, Family and Fruitful Labor, would be Exile and Wasted
Effort: Malacath. Malacath is an inversion of Mara because while he is strongly in
favor of family, it is a necessity, not a luxury. And as seen with Orsinium, though
the Orcs work very hard (Zenithar), they are <strong>not</strong> rewarded for it as
they deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
Zenithar and Arkay are Creation and Proper Death; Mehrunes Dagon is Wanton
Destruction and Needless Death. Mehrunes is exactly opposed to his two neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
Arkay can be seen as Night and Day of the life cycle, and Kyne is the Watchful
Mother. Azura, Dusk and Dawn, would therefore complement Arkay and as a guardian to
the Dunmer, she somewhat mirrors Kyne. Azura therefore takes E&#9839;.
        </p>
        <p>
Kyne the War-Wife and Stendarr the Just would be inverted in Conquest, Domination,
and Injustice. If this isn&rsquo;t Molag Bal, I don&rsquo;t know what is.
        </p>
        <p>
Akatosh&rsquo;s opposite-twin brother-foe is Lorkhan. Lorkhan&rsquo;s mirror and
aspirant among the Princes is Boethiah. Boethiah therefore would stand close to
Akatosh, and since Existence-by-Will is antithetical to Existence-by-Law, it stands
between Stendarr and Akatosh.
        </p>
        <p>
Akatosh is mad; Julianos is knowing. Sheogorath is knowledgeable and credited with
inspiring information&rsquo;s creation (music, poetry, etc.) and also the embodiment
of insanity. It stands to reason that he neighbors Akatosh and Julianos.
        </p>
        <p>
Lastly, Mephala uses information as a weapon rather than a workbench and sex as a
means to death rather than life. This places her squarely between Julianos and
Dibella.
        </p>
        <h2>
Low Daedra
        </h2>
        <p>
I now have five intervals with two sub-sub-accidentals each (E-F and B-C are
subdivided once only), and of the sixteen Princes, seven have been used and nine
remain. It must be remembered, however, that Jyggalag and Sheogorath are no longer
the same entity, thanks to the CoC&rsquo;s (and possibly Arden-Sul&rsquo;s)
Mantling. Jyggalag&rsquo;s inclusion brings us to ten Princes and ten notes to fill.
        </p>
        <p>
I used the same placement pattern as before, though by now I was working more
haphazardly since I was tired and there was more vagary in fitting Princes to Notes.
        </p>
        <p>
I figured Namira would fit nicely between Mara and Malacath, since her followers
tend to form covens and wreck families. Vaermina&rsquo;s nightmares made Labor
difficult and were a Scourge to those who received them.
        </p>
        <p>
Clavicus Vile is Destructive Trade and Peryite is Destructive to Life.
        </p>
        <p>
Meridia <strong>had</strong> to go next to Kyne, and Kyne&rsquo;s other side was
taken by Azura. Meridia does espouse a sense of Justice, so this isn&rsquo;t ramming
a square peg in a round hole, and she does try to assert Dominion over undead and
has had Dominion stripped from her when exiled from Aetherius. On the other side of
Molag Bal, Hircine represents both Domination and Submission in the Hunt, and cares
little for Ethics outside the Chase.
        </p>
        <p>
Sanguine is absolutely amoral and where Boethiah is the Prince of Plots, deceit, and
victory, Sanguine is Prince of Debauchery. Boethiah&rsquo;s followers will kill to
prove their worth; Sanguine&rsquo;s will do it for fun. Sanguine&rsquo;s
guilelessness and lack of motive make him a good counter to Boethiah.
        </p>
        <p>
As Akatosh is the oldest Aedra and Boethiah the most prominent Daedric Prince,
Nocturnal too enjoys a position of primacy. As the Ur-Dra, she is the oldest Daedra
and although she may not choose to exert her full strength, she does command a great
deal of respect and, perhaps, even fear among her fellow Princes. She therefore
stands among her two fellows of power, enjoying her position in their respective
shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
Hermaeus Mora is tied firmly to Auri-El through Xarxes and to Akatosh through the
fragmentation of Creation, and enjoys the insanity of an unindexed library, placing
him firmly between Akatosh and Sheogorath.
        </p>
        <p>
On Sheogorath&rsquo;s other side is the other form of madness. Whereas Sheogorath is
insanity plain and simple, Akatosh is insanity so prevalent that he must struggle to
retain any semblance of solidity, and fractures at the slightest trigger. Jyggalag,
however, is madness repressed and buried, attempting to mask itself between
attention to order and detail so extreme that it too is madness. But whereas Akatosh
raves and Sheogorath cackles, Jyggalag stands quiet. Jyggalag&rsquo;s madness is the
other end of the spectrum from Akatosh&rsquo;s, and so is on the other side of
Sheogorath from Akatosh. I don&rsquo;t have a good reason to place him next to
Julianos, though.
        </p>
        <p>
And that&rsquo;s why I ordered the Tones as I did.
        </p>
        <h1>
Colors
        </h1>
        <p>
The standard color wheel divides into Red, Green, and Blue sections and is defined
as running from Red (0 degrees) to Green (120) to Blue (240). I again elected to
make Akatosh a foundational element, and dividing the Octave into thirds placed the
other two colors at Kyne and Malacath (A, C&#35;, and F). Kyne&rsquo;s Nature
associations and Malacath&rsquo;s Blood associations gave them Green and Red,
respectively, leaving Blue for Akatosh.
        </p>
        <p>
From there, the rest fell into place mathematically. A 24-section wheel has each
section fifteen degrees wide, and I merely worked my way through the list.
Incidentally, the antipoles (cyan, yellow, and magenta) fell on Arkay (yellow),
Molag Bal (cyan), and Boethiah (magenta). I don't have any fancy meanings for that.
        </p>
        <p>
Anyway, if you want to see a rather pretty table with black/white/grey piano keys
and the actual colors, for visual reference, here it is. I&rsquo;ll probably procure
sine tones of the notes eventually.
