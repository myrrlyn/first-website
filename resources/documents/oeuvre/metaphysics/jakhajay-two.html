        Further Analysis of the ja-Kha&#39;jay
    </h1>
    <section>
        <p>
(Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to deconstruct the
word &ldquo;ja-Kha&#39;jay&rdquo;. Given that we know kittens are called
&ldquo;ja&#39;Khajiit&rdquo; and that the suffix -iit refers to doing/being and
Kha- is desert, making Khajiit one who deserts (the sandy place, not the flight
from duty), then ja&#39; must by necessity mean young. We can therefore
extrapolate that ja-Kha&#39;jay comes to mean young-desert-order or something
similar.)

In yesterday&rsquo;s post about Analysis of the ja-Kha&#39;jay, I outlined the
information that /u/solthas, myself, and other members of the memospore IRC
collated and interpreted. I also promised to continue working on the
mathematical model of the two moons with regard to the morphologies and each
other.

My first attempts in this area were to grant Masser more phases, as I believed a
6M x 4S grid would allow for all 24 forms of Khajiit. However, doing so also
made it difficult for the moons to reach all forms, so I went back to working
with the 4x4 grid to which we are accustomed. It then occurred to me that I
might make Masser go through its four phases at a slower rate than did Secunda.
I began by defining one cell as one arbitrarily long time unit (I prefer to go
with one week in my head but the exact translation of Nirn-time to a cell is not
terribly important and can easily change), and then writing out a table such
that each phase of Masser (m0, m+, m1, m-) took five cells, and each phase of
Secunda (s0, s+, s1, s-) took four. I then began at the top left corner of
m0<sup>1</sup> , s0<sup>1</sup>, and moved one cell down and to the right and
put a counter in that cell. When I reached s-<sup>4</sup> or m-<sup>5</sup>, I
returned to the beginning of the respective row or column, and continued on. In
doing so, it took 80 iterations to reach the end of the path and return to the
origin. (See Lunar Chart sheet)

        <table id="trawl" class="moons fullpath">
            <tbody>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
In conclusion, I ran the equations for Masser and Secunda through Wolfram|Alpha
and have included them below, individually and in combination. The total graph
domain of 80 matches the 80 iterations found above. The
<code class="math">p</code> element in each equation is the phase shift value,
which in increments of <code class="math">0.5</code> shunts each equation by a
quarter-cycle. The amplitude represents the phase of the moon, with -1 being New
and 1 being Full. Each linked equation is shifted to open at
<code class="math">[x,y] = [0,0]</code>, though this is purely cosmetic.

rotations in the 80-point course.

The combination of these two functions yields an interference-pattern with a
period of 80, as seen in the chart on the provided document. This graph
represents the interplay of the two moons. For this graph, amplitude correlates
to the average phase of both moons, and is utterly meaningless in determining
which form is being selected.
        </p>
        <p>
I must note that, as we have no information on the Lunar Lattice, this should be
taken solely as the extrapolation that it is. It is also not a finished work, as
evidenced by the M6S4 sheet in the spreadsheet, which holds no presentable finds
as yet. This is simply a means to interpret the information we have on the moons
and Khajiit morphology. The numbers I have chosen (5 and 4) for the lengths of
the lunar phases are wholly arbitrary, and are used because they provide a short
full-cycle (if one cell is equal to one week, then the cycle repeats in under a
year and a half) and good spacing of the forms.
        </p>
        <p>
Again, I hope that the information presented is useful or at least interesting
to you. I still have nothing to present on the Mane, but much as the terrestrial
eclipse system is dissociated from the phase-cycle, perhaps Nirn&rsquo;s
eclipses are also their own functions tied to the mythic needs of the Khajiit,
whereas the standard lunar phasing is &ldquo;merely&rdquo; a timekeeping device
to which the Khajiit forms have been hitched.
        </p>
        <p>
Lastly, I&rsquo;d like to again credit everyone in the IRC who helped on this
document, especially /u/solthas who has a keen eye for mapping out the tables in
sensible ways, and who has corrected me several times on how the tables should
be laid out. I (regrettably) didn&rsquo;t listen to her when doing the Lattice
plotting because going from m0<sup>1</sup> and s0<sup>1</sup> was the most
convenient, but now that the functions are mapped out they can be shifted
forward or backwards with ease. The math work was done pretty much on my own,
but it would be absolutely meaningless without the foundation work they put in.
