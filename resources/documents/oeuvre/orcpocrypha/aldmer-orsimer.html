        Transformation from Aldmer to Orsimer
    </h1>
    <section>
        <p>
Before their transformation, the Orsimer were part of the Aldmer community,
along with what would become the Altmer, Ayleid, Bosmer, Chimer, and Dwemer.
Although the branching points of each subgroup of the Aldmer mother race is
unknown, it is current belief that the group which would become the Orsimer were
not a self-contained culture of Aldmer, but rather spread throughout the
populace with their only distinguishing feature being close worship of Trinimac.
        </p>
        <p>
Trinimac, or &ldquo;the Knight of Auri-El,&rdquo; was an Aldmer god who
personally ripped out Lorkhan&rsquo;s heart at the Convention, or Ada-Mantia.
Trinimac was fiercely loyal to Auri-El and the Aedric cause, namely, leaving
Mundus and returning to the pre-Creation state. Trinimac continued to speak out
violently against Shor/Lorkhan and his works, including Men and Mundus. To the
Elves, Trinimac represented strength, honor, dignity, and valor. Those elves who
best exemplified those qualities would have been considered his
&ldquo;sons.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of Plots, for reasons of its own chose to sunder a
large group of Aldmer from the parent culture. To do so, it spoke to an elf
named Veloth, who would become a prophet as a result of this. Veloth gathered
followers and Boethiah spoke to them. Boethiah somehow consumed Trinimac, and
spoke to the Velothi using Trinimac's voice to speak ill of the Aedric gods, to
inform the gathered Velothi of the Psijic Endeavor (PSJJJJ), as well as to
demonstrate how the elves should perform an Exodus and depart for what would
become Morrowind, where Lorkhan&rsquo;s heart lay in Red Mountain. To conclude,
Boethiah expelled Trinimac. The experience of being consumed by a Daedric Prince
radically altered the Knight, transforming him into his own antithesis. This
spirit took the name Malacath, and both he and his child elves were ostracized
from their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
The antithesis of valor, bravery, and courage is not cowardice, fear, or
treachery. The latter are the absence of the former, not the opposite. The
opposite is barbarism, brutality, and rampant ferocity. These are the defining
aspects of the Prince Malacath, and they are reflected in his children. Once
proud, noble, valiant champions of order and civilization, they were reduced to
near-bestiality, savages living on the fringes. Now ugly, with green-hue skin,
prominent mandible fangs, and in some cases bone ridges along the eyebrow or
forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
As a result of their transformation along with their god Trinimac, the
newly-made Orsimer worshipped Malacath, for he was the only entity who would
have anything to do with them. Reviled by the Aedra and Aldmer, spurned by the
Daedra and Chimer, and hated by the Men, the Orcs were driven away from the
Aldmer homeland and eventually settled in the mountains of High Rock and
Hammerfell, though bands were scattered throughout Tamriel.
        </p>
        <p>
Thus begins the Orcish history.
