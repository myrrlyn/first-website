        Orcish Naming Customs

Overview
        </h1>
        <p>
Orcs all have basically the same name. Given name, prefix-surname. Very simple,
very universal. I like that about the Orcs. Gives them a big sense of community,
though not variety, that other races just don't quite have.
        </p>

        <p>
Known Orcish names consist of the Orc&rsquo;s own name, followed by gro-Father or
gra-Mother, depending on the Orc&rsquo;s gender.
        </p>
        <p>
This can be seen in <i>Skyrim</i> in the case of siblings Moth gro-Bagol and Ghorza
gra-Bagol.
        </p>
        <p>
There are anomalies to this pattern, however. &ndash;Largash and &ndash;Dushnikh are
both surnames of Orcs. Largash is from the Largashbur Stronghold, and Dushnikh from
Dushnikh Yal.
        </p>
        <p>
One of these characters (I believe the gra-Dushnikh one, but I don&rsquo;t remember)
is known to have a mother, but the father is not made clear to the PC. The character
is female, and so her surname should be the mother&rsquo;s name, not the Stronghold.
However, the Orc in question had left the Stronghold and her mother, so perhaps she
took the Stronghold name as a way to identify herself by tribe while distancing
herself from her immediate family.
        </p>
        <p>
Elves in general do not seem to use familial names. Altmer and Bosmer are almost
universally only given one name. Dunmer have House names, but it is common for the
unaffiliated to have one name or a second name that is unconnected to their family.
Orsimer have the only clearly familial naming tradition of the elves, yet even so
keep it limited.
        </p>
        <p>
Identifying an Orc by their parent or tribe serves as a convenient way to make short
associations, and can even be used to trace lineage, though this is painstaking. We
have not seen much of Orcish familial life, but I believe that their strongly tribal
culture means that children are raised collectively, and the patronymic or
matronymic serves as a means of identifying which Orc belongs with which parent at
the end of the day, though they are all grouped together otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
Stronghold names would be adopted by orphans or those who were casting off their
parents.

Now onto the language.
        </p>
        <p>
Orcs have their own "language" in <i>Daggerfall</i>, though this is just a value
check in the game mechanics, so I am not going to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
Orc names are almost always mono- or bi- syllabic. It is very rare for their names
to exceed two syllables per name. Notable examples are in Strongholds (Lar-gash-bur,
Nar-zul-bur) and a few Orcish names (Dush-na-mub). However, one and two syllable
names are the rule.
        </p>
        <p>
Next up, phonemes. Every race has a subset of the common alphabet from which they
draw their typical names. Orcs favor oral consonants. They are not guttural, but
also rarely labial. Consonants such as D, K, Z, G, N, R, and L are the most commonly
used. All of these are formed by manipulating the shape of the mouth and the
position of the tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
Interestingly, the vowel E is rarely encountered in Orcish names. On the UESP page
Lore:Orc_Names, the letter E occurs in the names all of four times. I is slightly
more common, but not by much. A, O, and U dominate the vowel population, and never
occur as diphthongs. Y occurs solely as a consonant.
        </p>
        <p>
From general observation, feminine names have more vowels and syllable breaks, and
less consonants per syllable, than do masculine names. The name I often use, Krognaz
gro-Makoza, is male for the given name and female for the surname. I don&rsquo;t
know how well that came across, but I&rsquo;m rather proud of it.
