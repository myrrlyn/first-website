It&rsquo;s finished. Finally, we finished it. The Dunmer promised us a weapon as
their bargain for the Armistice, but they didn&rsquo;t tell us we had to
assemble it ourselves. Well, we did. All it needs now is a Heart. Tiber Septim
himself arrived today, along with his battlemage and warlord, and tomorrow at
dawn they begin the ritual to awaken it. Whatever it is. It&rsquo;s just a
statue at the moment. A colossal, brass statue of a man. It has parts to move;
we had to fit together gears and pipes endlessly. Whatever this machine does, I
don&rsquo;t know if we should be proud or ashamed. If you are reading this, know

3E1. Midyear, I hope. Hall of the Colossus, I fear.

        <p class="journal">
Numidium awoke yesterday. We had to construct massive gantries to hold it as we
built it; they were called the Halls of the Colossus during the years of
construction. Now they will only be known as the Halls of the Folly, if the gods
are kind enough for any to remember. I fear that we have mishandled power too
great for any mortal. The Dwemer built this monstrosity, and the price they paid
for it was their extinction. Now we have awoken it, and what shall be wrung of
us for our pride?
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
The moment of its awakening was truly breathtaking. Tiber Septim, Zurin Arctus,
and a great shaggy Nord whose name we never knew stood on a platform in front of
its chest. They held a large stone. There was a blinding flash of light, a
deafening thunderclap, and it surged to life. It didn&rsquo;t move or change,
but we knew. Gods help us, it was <strong>alive</strong>. Tiber stood triumphant
on the gantry. A harsh light shone through a gaping hole in Zurin&rsquo;s chest
before his body toppled to the sand below, and a cloud of ash hung in the air.
Then we noticed what else had happened: clouds flashed across the sky around us,
but on the far horizon, nothing had changed. Men grew old, or young, around us.
Sometimes they flashed to skeletons and collapsed, and some shrunk to infants
and vanished. Some had the changed years reverse; some had their bodies pulled
in different directions by the eddies of time. My flight across the sand took me
to my youth and old age and back, and my left half is that of a man twenty years
my elder. I scribe this frantically, not trusting the sands any further. My
papers, new-bought last month, crack with age. My ink dries in the pen.
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
It moved. By all the gods, the monster moved. It&rsquo;s left the gantry. I
don&rsquo;t know where Tiber Septim is, but the machine is coming for us.

We call this the third era, now. The folly of the Cyrodiils marks a change for

There is no time for doubts. Not that there is time for anything, or time,

here we feel the ripples of Septim&rsquo;s Folly. Time rushes forward, then
backward, and… we don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. I&rsquo;ve seen mer
become thrice themselves, each following different paths of fate, then recombine
in a catastrophic event using details from all three. My colleague married three
different people three different times, and now his wife is a grotesque mash up

There&rsquo;s no point in recounting this. Numidium came for us.
<strong>A</strong> Numidium, anyway. We hear that there is fighting all across
Tamriel. Numidium is not with us constantly; perhaps it roams the continent. How
it moves so quickly we do not know. Perhaps it too split as did my colleague.
Perhaps it is everywhere. Perhaps it alone knows the one path through the
churned stream of Time to wander as it pleases incomprehensible to us strewn
ike flotsam in a flood.

The mainland is lost. We pulled back to Vvardenfell, to the Ghostfence. There is
an enemy inside, and they have blocked our Gods from their font of power. We
must reclaim it. We face the scourge of Corprus, and monsters beyond our
conception, but we must press on. There is no hope beyond the fire and ash of
the Mountain.

Tiber Septim began as just one of us. He came from the west, fought with us,

The bloody Nords and their treacherous cousins the Cyrodiils unleashed hell on
the world, and nobody else strikes against them. This is my sixth tour into
Nordic territory, and each time we find less and less resistance to us. The
hillfolk natives are increasingly violent, and have cycled through perhaps three
or four governments since we invaded. They are at times helpful to us solely
because we continue to strike into Skyrim,  and at other times close their gates
to us or even attack outright because we are not them. I do not expect them to
last, but they are a useful tool to harry the province.

We received word today that Numidium has turned its gaze upon the Iliac. Wayrest
has been sacked, as have Alcaire County and, praise be the gods, that barbarian
cesspit Orsinium. Our new orders are to pull back west, herding all the hillfolk
we can into Markarth, and emptying the mines. The high mages believe that we may
be able to use the silver to construct a defense against the Walking Brass. All
I care about, though, is that we strip the Nords of wealth and bring it home

Torval Station reports that massive numbers of Khajiit have flocked to the city,

VALENWOOD

        <p>
The towering graht-oak lumbers through the clearing, smaller trees crowding back
to make room. Its branches shake angrily in the wind, and the chittering screams
of the Bosmer in its branches race through the air. Behind it, shadowy shapes
flit through the dark forest. Aside from the creaking wood of the graht-oak, the
unearthly cries of the angered elves, and occasional deep, heavy thuds of
something impossibly heavy striking the earth, the forest is deathly silent.
        </p>
        <p>
Animals have never found perfectly safe haven in Valenwood, but their utter
absence is an event never before heard in living memory.
        </p>
        <p>
Standing sharply out among the dark browns and rich greens of the forest, a
blindingly bright brass tower flashes among the forest. It crashes through the
smaller growth, pausing only to batter resilient trees out of its way. It
charges after the graht-oak, missiles and magic peppering its skin. A fist like
the hammer of a god crashes into the graht-oak&rsquo;s trunk, shaking branches
and bodies out of the crown. An eerie keening light pierces the tree&rsquo;s
canopy in several places. Numidium strikes the tree several more times, ripping
limbs and vast swaths of foliage off of it and discarding them. The light
vanishes suddenly, and strange howls and roars echo through the vale.
        </p>
        <p>
Wave after wave of creature rush from the graht-oak. The towering brass walker
kicks and swings at them, but the horde manages to dodge. Mostly. Yipping and
screeching, the varied animals nip and climb the metal goliath. Neither side is
able to significantly damage the other, and though beasts are flung off with
every movement, the wild horde continues to pile onto the Dwarven construct.
Finally, it shakes some free and charges vigorously into the forest. Behind it,
the alien creatures disperse and the graht-oak lies toppled on the forest floor.

ARGONIA
        </h2>
        <p>
Deep in the dark and twisted maze of the Black Marsh, a wind attempts to stir
through the thickly-grown trees. It fails to move more than a few leaves. Dew
drips from the foliage, and sap runs like tears down the bark of trees. These
are no ordinary trees, however, if anything in the Marsh could be called
ordinary. There is an aura of ancient malice surrounding them, and they exude a
strong sense of forbiddance upon any who have the misfortune to stray near.
These are no common marsh trees, no; these are the Hist.
        </p>
        <p>
Lizards form lines through the area, queued to come forward and drink of the
sap. As they wait, they eat whatever is at hand, leaves, insects, and animals
crawling or swimming through the mud. The area has been largely stripped bare of
plant life, and alongside the lines scamper other of the lizardfolk bringing
food from farther away. The lines progress slowly, but steadily. At the base of
the trees lie those who have already drunk of the sap. They grow emaciated,
their bodies elongating visibly, their bones moving according to the
Hist&rsquo;s desire. When the Hist have finished with each, the reptile stands
to its feet. The newly-shaped creature&rsquo;s eyes are glassy, and it moves
uncertainly at first. Soon enough, however, it lopes off into the foliage and
vanishes.
        </p>
        <p>
Smoke and screams rise from the little village, though the screams never last
long. On the black star-studded horizon, the dark and forbidding wall of the
Black Marsh looms angrily, and a steady tide of the reptilian denizens streams
westward. Argonians were no strange sights in Cyrodiil&rsquo;s Blackwood, but
these were no common Argonian travelers. The shortest of them stood two or more
heads higher than the villagers, their scales were flat black, and they were
significantly more musclebound than those to which the residents had become
accustomed. Furthermore, their faces were utterly different, though none could
say how exactly. Where groups of survivors lingered, inevitably one whispered
that these must be the rumored Naga. The whispers lasted as long as the
whisperers; that is to say, not long at all.

The column of Marsh-monsters soon ran westward again, and yet more ruin and
sorrow joined the silent desolation of the eastern wood.

HAMMERFELL

Hammerfell&rsquo;s coastal cities lie sundered and smoking, their streets filled
with debris and bodies. Only the island city of Stros M&rsquo;Kai remains
untouched, separated from the mainland by depths Numidium elected not to cross.
Inland, deep into the wastes of the Alik&rsquo;r Desert, Redguard life is
stirring.
        </p>
        <p>
As the sand finally subsides, the cloud of the vicious sandstorm still visible
in the distance, a half-buried door creaks open. A form wrapped in cloth peers
out. It looks around and, apparently satisfied, opens the door fully. The figure
drags a set of wooden poles out from the shadowy recesses and begins assembling
them into a sand-fly.
        </p>
        <p>
A column of Redguards from all walks of life; warriors, craftsmen, families and
even their livestock winds northward from Taneth. The city lays in ruins behind
them, the latest in a string of coastal attacks from the Septim machine. Scouts
ride out ahead of the column, seeking out little-used landmarks of the
Alik&rsquo;r Desert.
        </p>
        <p>
Several days&rsquo; journey for the column finally ends when a scout rushes to
the main body. He points them in the direction of the door and sand-fly, and
elated, they strike out. Upon arrival, the cloth-wrapped watchers usher everyone
inside, and shut the door behind them. The gleaming brassy door gradually
vanishes beneath the ever-shifting sands.

SUMMURSET
        </h2>
        <p>
As the sun breaks over the eastern horizon, its rays fall on a once-fair island
since ravaged by wanton destruction. Mangled colors lie strewn over the
landscape like shards of a stained glass window, and painfully vivid colors jut
at angles out of the sculpted ground riven by furrows and craters. In curious
disparity with the ruin, scattered at random among the broken isle are counties
untouched by the chaos around them. The occasional detachment of elven mages
roam the landscape, escorting noncombatants to the ferry-ports of the minor
sister. Some pause among the chaos, and under their attention the shards of
broken color flow back into the ground, which returns reluctantly to the
carefully-designed shape generations of elves had given it. Their efforts do
little to reverse the catastrophe inflicted upon their soil, but even this
slight restoration brings some hope to the elves.
        </p>
        <p>
On the coast, the latest in the seemingly incessant rash of Maormeri
sea-brigades circles the Walking Brass Tower. It stands up to its waist in the
sea, rebuffing magical blasts and crushing any vessels so unfortunate as to come
within its reach. Sea serpents and their riders dart among the fray, pelting the
machine with spells and seeking to distract it from the more powerful weapons
brought to bear by the raiding ships. Frost coats the metal skin of the golem
even as the sea boils into steam around it and flashes of lightning skitter
across its skin and the water around it. Its arms blur at intervals, and spells
thought to have struck home fizzle short or careen at angles to their original
course. The ocean flickers around it, seemingly moving at odds with the rest of
the sea. Waves jerk to a stop, or pass through at frightening speeds. Flotsam
drifting close to the construct disintegrates spontaneously, or is twisted and
cut upon itself and changes form at sharp and sudden intervals. On the shore, a
glimmering spire rises out of the ground, gleaming in the sun&rsquo;s light,
throwing aloft a pillar of spell-wrought energy. The clouds part around the
beam, the shining lance evaporating any wisps that stray too close to it.
        </p>
        <p>
At long intervals, the spire launches a blistering barrage of energy towards
Septim&rsquo;s metal warrior. Most of the barrage strikes home, though some land
among the waves or Maormeri ships. Numidium glows ruddy under the onslaught, and
the intense heat boils the sea around it. Metal runs like sweat down its form,
and its limbs slow and bind at times. The ever-present tumult of Time
surrounding the giant shows a flicker-flurry of motion, and metal streams into
shaped order and fractured chaos alike. After the latest spell-strike ceases,
the sea-mist clears to reveal the Maormeri brigade streaming smoke with their
hulls holed and rigging ragged and torn; Numidium&rsquo;s rapid strikes during
the blinding chaos destroyed several ships and more were sailing low in the
water.
        </p>
        <p>
The fracturing of Time around Numidium grows stronger still, and in a blur it
charges to shore and east across the Isles, and vanishes out of sight. Its path
is littered with burned and broken bodies, buildings, and strewn rubble. Behind
it, tired elves stolidly resume their tasks.

Skyrim is in chaos, Your Majesty. Word has it that the Dunmeri assault on
Vvardenfell drove a native species called the cliffracer westward, and their
arrival in Skyrim brought about resurgence of their Dragon Cult. The Reach and
Haafingar are embroiled in civil war with natives and High Rock, and the middle
holds are fighting two fronts and paralyzed as a result. High Rock assaults
Skyrim and is reported to be constructing a potential defense against Numidium
on Balfiera. Hammerfell&rsquo;s coast is destroyed, and her survivors are
retreating inland to the Alik&rsquo;r desert. Our spies cannot follow. Valenwood
has gone dark and is reputed to be embroiled in a Wild Hunt on a scale never
seen before. Towns near the border have fled closer inland. Elsweyr has expelled
all foreigners and killed any they discovered after that. We do not know what
they do. Argonia sends assault columns regularly against the southern woods, and
while Leyawiin holds out due in part to Numidium, it is starving and weakening.
As for Summerset, they continue to occupy most of its attention.

The Direnni Tower dominates the Island of Balfiera. The original structure is
the core of a large fortress constructed by the Direnni clan and then the
Bretons over the millennia, though the gleaming silver shaft still looms far
above the roof of the mortal-made stone structure. The newest addition to the
complex is a massively intricate silver rune-form, writ across the ground and
walls with arcane sigils carefully traced. Evidence of construction is

It, unlike the larger effort, is complete and glows with a pale light of its
own. Thirty-six chairs adorn the rooftop: along the circumference of the silver,
the octants each bear a cluster of four, and in the center, the final four face
outward along the axes of the compass.
        </p>
        <p>
The scaffolding around the Tower bears a quiet procession. As they reach the
top, the dignitaries quietly file to their seats. The rim holds elves from the
Isles, Valenwood, and Morrowind, as well as Redguards, Bretons, Nords, and even
four reptilian representatives of the Marsh. Four Khajiit also appear, having
been dispatched by their Mane. The Cyrodiils are, of course, not present. In the
center stand the three members of Morrowind&rsquo;s Tribunal and the current
head of Artaeum&rsquo;s Psijic Order, Lore Master Celarus. It is he who speaks
first.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="left">
            <p>
I thank you all for coming today. The menace of the Cyrodiils has affected us
all, and though it may have been difficult to set aside old prejudices between
us, the matter of the Septim and the Numidium concerns us all. I believe Vivec,
of the Tribunal, wishes to speak.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
The assembled representatives mutter angrily. It is no secret that Numidium
passed into Tiber Septim&rsquo;s hands from those of ALMSIVI. The gold-grey
half-man rises, and the whispers silence. He smiles slightly, and opens his
mouth. Though his exact words are untranscribable, he speaks of the myriad
time-shards splintering and dancing among the stars, and the multitudes of
worlds born into peace at the cost of those crushed into ruin under the heel of
the once-Dwarven machine. He speaks of love and loss and kalpic end and chaos,
and the grand magnificence of the years to come purchased at the cost of the
wounded world-scale of the inescapable present.
        </p>
        <p>
As Vivec ends his speech, a thundering roar is heard from a cloudless sky. The
rooftop gathering stands in alarm and looks to the south-east. There on the
horizon is a massive shadow swiftly drawing near. It is soon discerned to be a
flock of dragons, and at their head, an enormous red creature bearing a figure
on its neck.
        </p>
        <p>
Naafalilargus lands atop the Tower, scattering chairs and dignitaries, and the
Emperor Tiber Septim alights. The other dragons circle the Tower, clinging to
its side or landing on the ground or staying aloft. Tiber strides silently,
majestically, to the very center. Lore Master Celarus opens his mouth, and
stares dumbfounded and quiet when Tiber raises his hand. The Tribunal reacts in
various ways: Almalexia begins rallying magicka, Vivec stands off to the side,
half-smiling and half-sorrowed, and Sotha Sil immediately vanishes in a puff of
energy. His voice deep and commanding, Tiber intones:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="tiber-septim">
            <p>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
A wave, near-invisible, ripples out from Tiber Septim. As it passes through each
dragon, the creature crumples, collapses, and begins to burn. As the scaly flesh
disintegrates, brilliant streams of light flow from the corpses to the Emperor,
who shines like a star descended as he consumes their power. Surrounded by a
storm of light and crackling energy, rivers of draconic magic rushing into him,
he hovers slightly over the silver filigree the Breton mages had carefully laid
out. It begins to melt, and with it, the large design on the island&rsquo;s
surface. Tiber opens his eyes and laughs, a deep, rich, powerful laugh booming
out from his throat, sweeping its path clear. The ever-present tumult in time,
to which the others have long grown accustomed, suddenly reverts to calm,
ordered linearity. The change is abrupt, and the madness&rsquo; absence now
seems mad. Almalexia lies gibbering on the floor in front of him, and Vivec has
vanished in the interim, leaving his garments discarded. Celarus opens a portal
and steps through, and the thirty-two remaining folk burn blinded by the glory.
A deep rumbling shudders through the Tower, and through the island as a whole,
and Tiber Septim roars with the Voice of a God. Ada-Mantia rises into the air,
vortices of wind and light whipping around it, and atop it rides the new-made
Talos. Aetheric fire surges around him, obscuring his form behind scourging
light. Ada-Mantia rises and rises, escaping at last the depths to which it sank
when it was first created. The sun itself dims in the sky, and the two moons
tremble. Finally, the Tower is above the ground, and the piercing light of the
God atop it shines across the land. Spread out across Tamriel, lone dragons soar
above the clouds, shouting their triumph for all the land to hear.

Sotha Sil emerges from the tunnel leading back into the bowels of Red Mountain.
Lit by the ruddy glow of the eternal fires, he carries in his arms an object
covered with a thin cloth. It pulses slowly with a diffuse light. He nods to the
House Magi around him, who fall in step, and they proceed down the mountain
pathway to the gaping chasm of Akulakhan. Revealed by Vivec&rsquo;s strike using
Baar Dau, the towering construct, only partially completed at the time, was a
hidden project of House Dagoth&rsquo;s. Under Seht&rsquo;s direction, it was
built only to the point of bare functionality, and its bare skeleton is a stark
contrast to Numidium&rsquo;s gleaming golden skin. The procession winds its way
around Akulakhan&rsquo;s skeleton, stopping at the void in its chest. The
Indoril mage bows to Sotha Sil, then removes the cloth. Seht&rsquo;s burden, the
Heart of Lorkhan itself, rests cradled in his arms. He releases it and, floating
on a cushion of magicka, it drifts into Akulakhan&rsquo;s waiting chest. Metal
bars snap to it, locking it into place, and siphoning its power with keening
blades. Daedric inscriptions all along Akulakhan&rsquo;s struts flare into
glowing life, exuding an ethereal blue glow spreading across the golem&rsquo;s
skeleton, a skin-sea whipped into a storm by a wind unfelt. Eyes blazing with
chaotic fire, the artifice sinks its claws into the rock wall and begins its
ascent. Behind it, Red Mountain groans and shudders, red lava and black ebon
bleeding from its fissures.

The Dunmeri siege of the Imperial Island began months ago, and it drags on
still. Neither our Numidium nor the Stormcrown&rsquo;s captured Tower are of
decisive efficacy against the Numidium that the sorcerer Seht has brought to
bear, but they do keep it from toppling us. Despite floating high above ground,
orbiting the Imperial Spire, the Second Tower moves very slowly and the Dunmer
keep moving into the Spire&rsquo;s shadow where Ada-Mantia cannot strike
directly. When their golem is visible from Ada-Mantia, though, the power it
unleashes is terrifying to behold. Spears like liquid flame lance forth from its
surface to land among the Dunmer, or on the golem&rsquo;s skin. The city-wheel
is smashed and burned from both the Dunmer and from our own Tower, and where our
flame-spears cut, the stone is polished smooth as if it had been built with
pieces missing. Talos continues to direct Numidium against the rebellious
provinces, those that still stand, trusting in Ada-Mantia and our own mages to
hold Cyrod.
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
As for the provinces, most lie in some form of ruin. Morrowind&rsquo;s mainland
is ravaged by the Marsh-monsters, and the volcano isle was smashed by
Vivec&rsquo;s Lie Rock and then ripped apart by the Second Numidium.
Argonia&rsquo;s outer reaches have been trampled by Numidium and burned by the
Legions. Elsweyr is, somehow, completely abandoned. A few feral Khajiit roam
here and there, but otherwise it appears to be wholly empty. Valenwood is still
embroiled in a Wild Hunt, parties of which occasionally spill over the border
into Cyrodiil and Elsweyr. Dragon-scouts soaring above the wood report that
Falinesti and the other graht-oaks still roam uncontested, but also uninhabited.
Whether or not pockets of Bosmeri civilization still hold out is unable to be
determined. Hammerfell&rsquo;s coast has been desolate since the beginning of
the War, and its population withdrawn inland. They have been largely isolated
since then, though sporadic sightings do occur. High Rock has been thrown into
complete chaos since the Stormcrown&rsquo;s Glory on Balfiera. Wayrest,
Evermore, Camlorn, and Jehanna are the four strongest of the Breton city-states,
and without the Bretons and Redguards to suppress them, the Orcs have even
managed to incorporate their Orsinium stronghold again. Their leader, a creature
called Krognaz gro-Ghazulob, has gone so far as to send emissaries to the Empire
seeking provincial recognition in return for fealty and military service.
Skyrim, unfortunately, is still sundered in a sea of blood. The Reach native
rebellion, apparently called the &ldquo;Forsworn Uprising&rdquo;, has engulfed
all of the Reach, most of Haafingar, and western Hjaalmarch, Whiterun, and Fell
Kreath. The roads out of Solitude are unusable, and the Bruma pass through the
Jeralls see refugee traffic daily. In the eastern holds, the Dragon Cult has
taken a firm grip on the populace. The Windhelm Chapterhouse now commands the
Rift, Winterhold, Eastmarch, and Dawnstar. The city of Whiterun is pressed
between both the Forsworn and the Dragonsworn, and reputed to be ready to
succumb to either.

The Summerset Archipelago sees most of Numidium&rsquo;s fury, and while the
cities hold strong, the countryside of the Isles has been largely ruined and
evacuated.

        <p class="journal">
This leaves only Cyrodiil. Although Argonian columns have made incursions
through the Blackwood and sacked Leyawiin, and the Dunmer burned the northern
Nibenean countryside on their march here, the Colovian marches remain relatively
intact. Most of the civilian population has been moved to the west, and the
eastern counties are thinly populated only by those who refused to move. Three
legions have been dispatched north to Skyrim, two hold the defense of the
Imperial Tower, and the remaining two guard the western plains.
        </p>

The Dunmer attacked again today. Their battlemages led the first assault,
launching a barrage of spells against the Spire. Our Whisperers managed to repel
most, but as always a few shots came through. The Tower is to the north today,
and the Dunmer camp is spread along the southern face. I do not envy their
constantly-rotating camp, and a central defense against a moving offense is an
inarguable advantage for the besieged. The Spire battlemages have been working
with Ada-Mantia&rsquo;s weapon controllers, and we may finally have a way of
arcing the Tower&rsquo;s assaults around the Spire, by passing the lances
through a magickally created lens.
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
Numidium just arrived. Its travel grows increasingly odd. One minute the Dunmer
colossus was pounding at the Spire uncontested, spells flashing back and forth
through the air and the dizzying distortion in the air arcing the Tower&rsquo;s
beams around us to strike at their golem, and the Brass Walker had stepped out
of thin air and slammed its fist into its rival&rsquo;s side. Watching the two
fight is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. With the Stormcrown atop Numidium
and Seht atop Akulakhan, both glowing with tremendous power, and the two metal
constructs scraping the sky, the city-wheel and the Dunmer army below seem as
ants in comparison. My unit is stationed near the top of the Imperial Spire, and
yet we stand at the shoulders of the two gargantuan constructs. They wade
casually through the city and lake, kicking aside buildings like anthills and
water like puddles. It is almost like two men boxing on a small model of a city,
only there are no roars or grunts or sounds of fist striking flesh. The silence
is eerie, punctuated only by the rumble of their movement, the occasionally
shrill screech of spell-barrage, and the dull clang of metal colliding.
        </p>
        <p class="journal">
By the Divines! Seht charged Talos, throwing him against the Spire! The whole
building leans to the north now, but he somehow staved in Aku&rsquo;s knee and
drove him into the water. Numidium PICKED UP the other golem, with the Dunmer
sorcerer flung free, and HURLED it south to the river! The Walking Brass turned
its attention on the Dunmer army next, but by now they&rsquo;ve grown practiced
to scattering beyond its reach. The situation is much like a man surrounded by
flies, with no way of trapping them where he can crush with ease. Talos
recognizes this, of course, so Numidium soon vanishes in the same manner as it
appeared.

The human tendency for intercommunication is amazing. Even though we have sealed
ourselves in these Rourken cities, the necessities of survival mean that surface
caravans are a periodic occurrence, and with them travels news and rumor almost
as a plague. For once, they are even mostly true. Or at least in agreement. They
say that the Cyrodiils have a new-made God. That the Dunmer have a second Brass
Monster that they are using to fight the Cyrodiils. And the strangest, and most
easily confirmed: the Khajiit have left Nirn. They climbed to the moons again
and live there in paradise. This must be true, for a third moon has appeared in
the sky, and our lens crafters have been able to magnify it, and the moon

Our scholars have been poring over all documents and artifacts of the Yoku Sword
Singers ever since we took to the deeps. We know from bitter experience that
merely cutting at Septim&rsquo;s monster will not hurt it, but the Singers did
not merely cut. Shamans and swordmasters alike have been desperately trying to
recreate the lost legends, and our city has shown some success in this. Last
month, Boraccag successfully summoned what we believe to be a Shehai. The spirit
sword did not exactly match the descriptions in our old texts, but it WAS a
sword, and it WAS immaterial. He practices daily, and each time he summons it,
the blade is stronger and longer-lasting. Texts speak of a spirit-slice that
cuts so finely that reality parts around it. Surely Numidium cannot resist such
a stroke. If we can discover a way to do this, we may have an end to end this
hellish war once and for all.

This cursed war has gone on for more than twenty years, now. I can remember
it&rsquo;s beginning, as clearly as yesterday. It may as well have been
yesterday, given Numidium&rsquo;s ruin of Time. I remember taking my men north
out of Cyrodiil. I remember Karl and Jormund wanting to go home, only to find
out that their homes were in ruin. And I remember the vise that has gripped
Skyrim since then, the Bretons and then the hill-savages in the western holds
and the bloody-handed Dragon Cultists in the east. Superstitious nonsense, we
thought. We knew the &ldquo;Harbingers of the Return&rdquo; were just
cliffracers chased out of Morrowind, but to have the Dragons return in force
shortly afterwards? I would never have believed it had I not seen with my own
eyes Tiber Septim atop his colossus, he and the drakes Shouting back and forth.
He bent about half to his will, but the other half remain wild. They now govern
Windhelm, Riften, and Winterhold. What&rsquo;s left of it, anyway. The Tongues
of Hrothgar came down from their summit to try and counter the menace of the
Cult, but we have heard nothing save the awful roars since their departure. I
pray that Shor and Kyne watch over them, and bring them to halls of valor in
this life or the next.

It seems that Tamriel is spending all the disasters she has saved up for
millennia in one short burst. As if Numidium, civil war, and Dragons
weren&rsquo;t enough, the city of Winterhold was destroyed by a tsun-ahm.
Everyone thinks it was from the Dunmer slamming their &ldquo;tame&rdquo;
sky-rock into the volcano. The Red Mountain has been erupting continuously
since, and the ground around it shakes with a fury. I certainly can&rsquo;t
think of anything else that would cause such a wave. Dawnstar and even Solitude
were hit as well, but the distance preserved them.

passes to Cyrodiil, then bring southern legions north to our aid. But in my
heart, I don&rsquo;t believe we will succeed.

It still seems impossible that the Starry Heart has seen not merely one, but
three events of such incredible potency that each has caused a calendar reset in
a single lifetime, even of the men. Perhaps the haste to change Eras is caused
by a hope that a new Era will bring with it actual change (a child&rsquo;s wish
and folly), or perhaps the concept of time-keeping is as weakened as broken as
Time itself. Still, one cannot deny that the usurpation of divinity by three

The Khajiit departure still mystifies our scholars. We&rsquo;d hoped that we

coerce their return, but efforts have been so far unsuccessful, and our energy
was best spent on immediate defence. As for the third moon of the Mane, it seems
to have no effect on the tides and is only a reminder of the impossible
bitterness of the southern sands. And our feral cousins in Valenwood, well,
they&rsquo;ve truly gone beyond any semblance of civilization. Not even the Sea
Folk will sail near those hauntingly silent shores. Our only neighbors have been
the Yokudan desert-folks to the north, who have always been oddly educated and
civilized for men. This is fortunate, as ever since the Activation, they have
provided us with some aid. And now this has come to fruit, in their means of
destroying the Numidium. It will not be a clean victory, but then, what

Upon Numidium&rsquo;s latest arrival to the Tower, to lay siege yet again to our

soon as it reached our walls, creating a massive dome of solidified light. The
monster is trapped with us, and with a fleet of the Sea Folk who volunteered to
harry it to the end. This is our death, but it shall be the death of the Machine

The elf shuts his journal and looks outside. He turns and screams,
&ldquo;Boraccag! Now!&rdquo; The Yoku man stands and joins him at the sill. A
massive bronze limb streaks past and slams into the tower&rsquo;s structure
beyond them. The building shudders, and cracks race through the crystalline
walls. Dust drifts through the air. Boraccag nods silently, his eyes empty and
face dead, and turns away. He walks down the hall, slowly shifting to a lope,
then a run. He descends the myriad staircases, passing huddled elves and men who
look at him with haunted, despairing eyes. On the outside walls, gaping holes
are surrounded by the broken bodies of those who were either killed directly by
the metal mountain, or who drew too strongly on the sun&rsquo;s fire and
destroyed themselves. The blinding light of the dome shines through each flaw in
the edifice, illuminating those within with a baleful glare.
        </p>
        <p>
Metal screams and crystal snaps as the titanic monuments to engineering and
poetry are pinned fast together. The hiss of molten metal is loud in
Boraccag&rsquo;s ears as golden drops plummet to the ground like rocks. Through
the gaps in the Big Walker&rsquo;s leg-struts, he can see the Seal fracturing
against its alien skin. It will not hold forever, or even for long.
        </p>
        <p>
As he silently pulls his scimitar from its catch, he closes his eyes. Thirty
years of life, all that he can remember living in fear and hiding and
desolation, drift through his mind. His parents. His friends. Growing up in the
deepest halls of those who made the monstrous construction before him. Learning
only one thing for all of his remembered life: the Song of the world; the Song
of his blade. His people knew only rumors of myths at the Awakening, but thirty
years of sole focus work wonders for those who know how to Make their Way. And
all of it led to this. And none of it would lead away.
        </p>
        <p>
Another crash boomed through the elven tower. Boraccag gazed in eerie quiet at
the scimitar in his hands. It is a work of art, a masterpiece of metal-craft.
        </p>
        <p>
He drops it to his side, and steps forward. A gargantuan brass foot crashes
through the door, coming to a creaking stop a few yards before him. He sets his
feet just so. Breathes in the metallic, tangy, dusty air. Closes his eyes
against the shimmering, blinding light. Though the gentle glow of the form in
his hands is seen only by a dying maga, he knows that it is there, as surely as
he knows his hands without seeing. It is his Shehai.

Tears stream freely down Boraccag&rsquo;s angular, dark face as he stands in

The world flashed white and a soundless shock tore through the sky, rushing
across land and sea and flattening everything in its path. The unnatural silence
lasted a mere instant before thunder roared as the shockwave expended itself and
crashed back to the center. The air around the shattered tower turned a jellied
blue as it was crushed under unimaginable pressure, and the heat ignited grass,
dirt, and the ruined pages drifting through the sky. The firestorm blazed for an
instant before starving, leaving only ash drifting down like black snow.
        </p>
        <p>
The gently falling ash billowed and parted as a colossus creaked forward. Metal
pieces, tarnished, burnished, and dull, rained down from it with every motion.
The ground where it stepped cracked and sunk under its weight, and bolts of
baleful blue lightning speared outwards from its skin, crackling around it in a
jagged nimbus. If there had been birds, they would have flown clear of it, for
to stray within that haze was Death. If there had been animals, they would have
fled from its footprints and its path, for in its wake was Pain. If there had
been Folk, but no, there were no Folk.

        <p>
The world was silent, with neither animals to call nor wind to gust nor Folk to
shout. The only sound was the interminable creaking, clattering metal as one
step led inexorably to the next. As the colossal machine reached the beach, its
left knee seized, then shattered, spraying metal fragments. Metal groaned, and
slowly at first and then with gathering speed, it pitched forward and crashed
into the water which erupted in a spray of mist and steam. Its head, once a mile

the ruined legs and feet slowly slipped beneath the waves.

The Ur Tower, still circling the White Gold, screamed a loud, vibrant Blue, the

earth-thrumming Midnight to shrill Sky. All across Tamriel, Jills flashed into
existence, their cries harmonizing with the coruscating Spire. The Tiberian Wars
had left scars across the continent that all could feel, though only the
Minute-Menders could see. From the sands of Elsweyr to the ash of Vvardenfell,
from Skyrim&rsquo;s shrieking blizzards to Valenwood&rsquo;s whispering forests,
the Jills raced along the rents in Akatosh&rsquo;s flesh, stitching together the
wounds writ by Numidium&rsquo;s passage. As they flew along the shattered and
scattered detritus of Time that Numidium left in its wake, picking apart,
examining, discarding, and stitching pieces into a rough approximation of
continuity and sanity, sometimes proceeding slowly and carefully and (more often
than not) racing ahead with wild abandon, feasting on Akatosh&rsquo;s wounds
even as they work to mend them. The life-threads of those they encounter are
often snarled and sometimes cut, but such is the nature of the imperfection of
scar-healing.

The waves didn&rsquo;t crash anymore; they hadn&rsquo;t for a long time now. The
waves brushed up against the beach almost accidentally, like a young boy unsure
how to handle his first crush. They approached timidly, struck the beach with
barely enough force or distance to qualify, and hastily retreated. The sea
wasn&rsquo;t calm, no, she was surely agitated, but for once she was the slave,
not the mistress. There shouldn&rsquo;t exist anything that makes the sea a
slave. Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s wrong. Not wrong like the undark men are
wrong, calling this world a blessing and a gift, but wrong like the world is.
But worse.

The sea stills, but only a fool would think it is a good stilling. It is the
stillness of the doe who first catches the whiff of the huntress; it is the
stillness of the man on the headsman&rsquo;s block. It is the stillness of
awareness of Death&rsquo;s touch, lightly brushing the shoulder, not yet a grip
but suddenly intimately, desperately close.
        </p>
        <p>
There, far out from shore, there is a bulge. The sea bends up towards the sky,
then runs outwards, almost as if fleeing. Bright, painful blue jagged lines rip
through the water, visible even through the distance and deflection. The weather
grows fragmented, confused. It isn&rsquo;t sure whether to be sunny or stormy or
cloudy and so it is all of these and none. Finally, the sea parts around a
gleaming yellow-bronze helm much as butter parts around a knife. The enormous
helm raises its face from the waves to the shore, its eyes burning with a
horrible light of no particular color. The helm continues to rise, exposing a
ruined facsimile of a face, then broad shoulders a league across surge above the
water, cascading waterfalls and steam from each crevice and surface.
        </p>
        <p>
The rent, ruined, torso smashes through the water, its head by now rearing
almost to the low clouds. Metal gantries and beams and pipes and gears push
skyward, in an endless stream of machinery and artifice. After almost half an
hour, the beginnings of its legs appear. One is twisted, torn, and thin;
although the machine is covered in burns, gashes where the metal had melted,
ran, and frozen again, fractures, and every sign of abuse, its left leg is in
by far the worst condition. The hulking mountain of metal limps out of the
ocean, dragging its left leg, and rears to its full height. It makes no sound
besides the creaking and groaning of its metal parts, the hiss of steam, and the
crackle of the lightning surround it, yet it emanates an unmistakable aura of
fury.
        </p>
        <p>
The helm turns slowly on its perch, nearly a mile above the sand, and grimly it
lumbers up the beach.

The Jills are everywhere across Tamriel, but the largest flock has been
retracing Numidium&rsquo;s route. They swarm around the pit on Balfiera, around
which silver and mnemolichite and marble wreckage are strewn, and just beyond
sight the air blazes with leftover myth from the Talos Apotheosis. One of the
Jills sinks her talons deep into a wound and screeches. Whatever she&rsquo;s
gripped, it&rsquo;s pulling her farther in. Her cohorts gather around her,
tearing the wound open and dragging her back into reality. Finally, she springs
free and the rift snaps shut. In her claws dangles a limp ash-and-aurum figure.

Hammerfell&rsquo;s population had begun trickling back to the coastal cities
almost as soon as word was received that Numidium was within the Alinori Seal,
but now that it had returned they&rsquo;d fled back to the Alik&rsquo;r in
droves. Those who stayed and tried to hide could only watch in horror as its
mountainous form crushed buildings and ground alike. Its footprints gouge deep
into the sand and rock and the sea rushes from one to the next, burying the city
acre by acre in the metal-monster&rsquo;s wake.

It neither flails nor roars, though it is unmistakably angry. Rather, it moves
with implacable resolve, methodically crushing the island city until only
scattered islets remain of Stros M&rsquo;Kai. Where the seafloor cracked under
its heels, the ocean smoked and boiled, wreathing the ruined remnants in soot
and steam.
        </p>
        <p>
Satisfied with its destruction, it turned its gaze northwards and strode back
into the ocean. Its wounds are plugged with dirt and stone, and its left leg no
longer limps.

Time has been ordered for most of Tamriel, with splinters fetched and crushed
together and divergent branches pruned, and while Akatosh is scarred, at least
he is no longer bleeding. The great Dragon coils tightly around Mundus, forcing
time into some semblance of a line, though it still has small fractures and
loops in places. It looks back and sees a sharp cut where Talos had resumed its
brother&rsquo;s shouting, though appending WE ARE to the ages-old I AM NOT. Far
to the side and forward another Dovahjoor eye gazes back, pondering reunion with
its stunted twin. Aka squirms, endless coils shifting and grating, and on every
scale-world-point, its son-Drakes erupt into existence.

The ever-present cries and screeches of the Jills to which Tamriel had gradually
become accustomed are joined by the deeper roars and Shouts of the Drakes, which
had been dwindling for two Eras but now returned in force. In Skyrim, the
resurgent Dragon Cult was soon brought to heel and pushed across the resisting
holds. The Dragon King, YOLMOROKRON3D, perched atop the Ur Tower high above the
Imperial City, drinking deep its power and breathing out with Royalty and
Splendor the long fire to burn back Cyrod&rsquo;s tangled jungles, leaving dry
plains and desert behind.

As Numidium crashes onto Hammerfell&rsquo;s southern beaches, massive pistons
thrusting its fists into walls and palaces and homes and refugees, the Mundane
world is crushed in a mirror of the Mythic. In dimensions imperceptible to the
mortal eye, the Dragon-forks crash together, the longer-running head biting down
on its shorter brother. AKA-DROG crunches its crystal jaws, shattering the bones
and scales of his smaller brother Z1M and swallowing them.

Numidium staggered as Mundus cracked, shattered, and reformed in infinitesimally
small zero-points of Creatia. Hammerfell&rsquo;s rocks and sands and sea rose
and fell and gusted with the mythic collision of the Aka Krenne and the
Jills&rsquo; frantic Mending. Numidium roared its refusal in return, attracting
swarms of Jills to the continuing fractures and negations emanating from the
golden smoking skin of the metal-mile mountain-machine. They screeched as they
tore into the fissures in reality Numidium left trailing, struggling desperately
to keep Reality together as the BorMaHu consumed itself. Numidium crashed
through Hammerfell with abandon, crushing the land beneath its boots and hurling
clumps into the sea and sky. Nirn&rsquo;s boiling blood rushes to the surface,
mixing with the seawater and flooding the air with smoke. Flocks of Jills,
over-eager and angered and desperate, rush the Numidium, only to be swatted or
shouted out of the air and the world. With impossible speed, the God of Refusal
finished its work, leaving the once-desert of the west sunken, pitted, burning,
and flooded. Islands rise here and there from the mist-blanketed waves, ruins
both Yoku and Dwemer jutting like broken bones. The crushing weight of the Aka
Convergence grinds down on the Machine, and it turns its gaze to the sky. There,
hanging low and huge and bloody, lies the land of VelothII. Fueled by rage and
revenge, Numidium stares up at Masser, seething in hatred.

The tower-legs collapse, folding and telescoping in massive complexity,
crouching the Colossus to its minimal height.

Belching steam, hissing and burning and shrieking
<span class="dwemer">NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</span> against the Void, the NUMIDIUM
flings itself from Nirn and erupts into the sky.
