## Purpose

This is largely a practice sandbox as I learn web development languages and
practices including the Big Three of

1. HTML
2. JavaScript
3. CSS

but also specialized server languages including

* C#
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby

I am also practicing various ideals of web design, such as device scaling, AJAX
transfers, session-state tracking, and any other behind-the-scenes magic making web
sites feel native.

This is primarily delivered by Microsoft Azure services, but may also jump to Amazon
AWS, GitHub Pages, or one of my personal machines.

## Content

One of the setbacks of practicing with content-delivery systems, which is exactly
what web pages are supposed to be, is not having any content to deliver. I
don&rsquo;t really create much yet, but here's pretty much all my visible work for
[/r/teslore](http://reddit.com/r/teslore/new) which comprises the vast majority, if
not the whole, of my oeuvre.
